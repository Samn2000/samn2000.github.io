                    <p>Callum Adams, formerly known as Sanjay Bennett, (born September 26, 1981), better known online as Callum's Corner, is an
                        English YouTube vlogger who rose to fame, particularly in British internet culture, after he
                        published a rant video threatening people who joked that his head was shaped like a Tic Tac.

                        believed his head looked like "a sodding tic tac", and admitted it did look like one. Callum
                        created a second channel called

                        less often. Videos on that channel include live subreddit reviews or investigations into problematic
                        content creators, such as Paul Breach and Ian Moore. It is also now used for his Meme Review series, having
                        previously uploaded episodes on his main channel.

                        He initially uploaded videos on Facebook and YouTube by making short videos sharing advice and
                        life stories. However, it wasn't until WillNE reacted to his infamous "Tic Tac" video that he
                        attracted the large audience that he upholds to this day. This original video, the following
                        diss track created on Callum by BGMedia artist Afghan Dan (with the help of WillNE), and his
                        innumerable appearances in other YouTubers' videos have cemented his place as an icon in the UK
                        YouTube scene.

                        Callum Adams was born on 26 September 1981 in Blackburn in the North of England to a working
                        class family. His family moved to the Isle of Wight when he was six months old, where he spent a
                        large amount of his childhood. When he was young, his father was exposed as having a secret
                        second family with another woman, leading to his parents' divorce. His mother forced him to
                        change his name to a "spirit" name, including taking a name from a different race, and her
                        maiden name (Bennett) - he chose the name "Sanjay" because he 'liked curries'. Callum later
                        said he regretted this decision as it led to bullying when popular Eastenders character Sanjay
                        Kapoor was revealed to be impotent. After school, he moved to Surrey where he went to Reigate
                        College, as stated on one of his live streams.

                        Not a lot is known about Callum's life through his twenties to now. He has previously said that
                        he used to be a insurance broker, and that he was engaged for a period of time. At some point
                        after college he moved to Bristol, where his mother lived with him as he took care of her. He
                        also worked as a carer in at least 2 care homes during this time; he quit his last care job in
                        Bristol over his hatred for it. People eventually found out Callum's address in Bristol; this
                        resulted in sex workers, Tesco Clubcard's and toasters being sent to his house en masse, the
                        latter of which came after his audience asked to see his kitchen appliances on live stream.

                        He moved back to the Isle of Wight in July 2020 to a small village called Bembridge. In
                        August 2021, trolls started review bombing and changing the names of locations in his village
                        which caused a shop owner in the village to confront him about the reviews. In June 2022, a
                        troll anonymously emailed his local churchwarden claiming Callum was a sexual deviant that
                        preyed on elderly men, lived out sexual fantasies as a merman, abused marine animals and
                        abducted strangers while roleplaying as Michael Jackson. In October 2023, he moved house
                        again to an undisclosed part of the Isle of Wight; he also started working as a carer again. In
                        June 2024, he was once again found by trolls when someone posted an allegation of paedophilia to
                        the family of a person he cared for - as a result of this, Callum is now considering quitting
                        his job and emigrating to Thailand.

                        Callum has two sisters, one unnamed, and rarely described as anything other than 'the one that
                        [he] likes' and his other sister 'Aimee' who is often the antagonist of his videos. Aimee is
                        described by Callum as 'life ruining' and her 'militant veganism' fuels Callum's thematic
                        opposition to veganism. Callum has two nieces (children of Aimee) and one nephew (son of the
                        other sister, that he does like), Eddie, who has appeared in a large amount of Callum's videos
                        before stopping due to sexually inappropriate memes about him and Callum. Callum also has
                        multiple cousins called including Gregory and Tim, though Callum's relation to Gregory has
                        been contended.

                    <p>
                        Callum also regularly streams on his Twitch account, where he plays games such as 'Wii Sports
                        Resort' and 'Crash Bandicoot', even when the community does not like the game he is playing. He
                        also does variety streams such as Sleep Streams, VR Streams and rare Hot Tub streams. He
                        constantly gets 'troll donations' where viewers spend the minimum amount of money ($3) to send a
                        text to speech message or a video link which will play on stream. This feature is meant for
                        songs and music but often abused to play racist songs, AI-generated music, and other types of
                        filth often regarding prominent figures in the community such as Elliot Rodger, Ian Moore, Jimmy
                        Savile, and up until recently, Minitom. More recently, Callum has also been exposed to gore
                        through his Twitch donations. In June 2022, Callum was banned from using Streamlabs due to
                        extremely inappropriate donations, including one where a penis was shown on stream. He now uses
                        StreamElements.
